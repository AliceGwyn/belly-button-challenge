To view the visualizations, make sure you have both the index.html file and the static folder containing app.js, then open this folder in VS code and 'Open with Live Server' on the index.html file by right clicking on the file name in the explorer panel.

This should open a webpage showing a metadata panel with demographic information, bubble chart, and bar chart with the top 10 observed bacteria for a pre-selected sample.

You can use the dropdown menu to choose other samples to view.

Hovering over a data point will produce a popup showing the number of bacteria observed as well as a description of the specific bacteria being referenced.

Or you can use this link: https://alicegwyn.github.io/belly-button-challenge/ to view in github pages
